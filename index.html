	<h2>Hi there. This is not like me.</h2>
	<p>At some point I decided to buy this domain to just keep. It's branded with my name and I don't want anyone else to have it but I have a bunch of other nice personal domains and this is still unused. To a point that I considered dropping it but .com zone has some sentimental value so I'm putting this page up as a placeholder. This is probably the domain I'll try to donate if anybody ever founds a legal defence fund or some kind of action organization in my name that operates independently. In a sense, this is an edge of my virtual identity, something that is my yet can be transplanted and live its own life, like a piece of skin. I will probably never operate a personal blog or anything too personal here yet this domain is properly mine.</p>
	<p>If you typed this address manually or followed some link from search being interested in my person somehow you probably want to check out one of these other sites I also have:</p>
	<p><a href="https://ivananishchuk.com/">ivananishchuk.com</a> is my main showcase page, sort of.</p>
	<p><a href="https://ivananishchuk.click/">ivananishchuk.click</a> is a more complete directory of my resources. Or will be some day. It's the next one I plan to work on.</p>
